# raylib.el

`raylib.is` is a [dynamic module](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Writing-Dynamic-Modules.html) for [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

It is in a very early stage, so don't expect anything to work reliably
or at all just yet.

## Usage
```elisp
(use-package raylib
    :load-path ~/.emacs.d/raylib)
```
